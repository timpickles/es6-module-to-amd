# ES6 Module to AMD RequireJS

This is a spike to see how straight forward it is to write ES6 code, transpile it via [6to5](https://6to5.org/)
and then make use of the code within an existing RequireJS project.

## Building this example

Build the example with grunt

    grunt

This will put all of the code which includes the transpiled ES6 code into the `dist` folder.
